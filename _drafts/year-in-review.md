I haven't ever thought about doing this before, but I was quite inspired by [David Miller's post](http://converged.yt/posts/yearnotes-2015/).  So inspired, that I have decided to do it myself!  In no particular order, a quick rundown of what I did in 2015 (filtered by what I remembered while writing this).

- USGS/Bureau of Reclamation drought visualization: In spring of 2015 some colleagues  at [USGS' Center for Integrated Data Analytics](http://cida.usgs.gov/) asked if I was interested in helping out with developing a data visualization of drought in the lower Colorad River.  Well, of course I was (and thanks to [Jordan Read](http://cida.usgs.gov/people/jread.html) and [Emily Read](http://cida.usgs.gov/people/eread.html) for the invite).  The resultant viz relied on open data and open source tools.  I worked on developing a [leaflet]() component.  Overall I played a very small roll.  The fantastic product that came out the other end was due to the ace crew at USGS and the other fantastic collaborators.  The [final product](https://www.doi.gov/water/owdi.cr.drought/en/index.html) is really cool. 

- Lake Trophic State paper accepted: This one was a LONG time coming.  I think our initial work was early in 2014, the end result is a paper to be published shortly in Ecosphere.  We used random forests, the 2007 National Lakes Assessment, and the 2006 National Land Cover Dataset to predict chlorophyll *a* and lake trophic state.  Details are in the [pre-print](), [repo](), and the final paper(not yet published).

- Ten Simple Rules for Digitial Data Storage Paper
- Microcystin and chlorophyll *a* associations paper drafted 
- Three R Trainings (well one was in Dec 2014)
- rhodyRstats
- quickampr
- lawn
- autocrop
- iale open science workshop
- cyanoscope
