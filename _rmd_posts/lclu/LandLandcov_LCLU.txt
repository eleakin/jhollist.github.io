  Description:
    Abstract:
      Landuse/Landcover for Vermont and the Lake Champlain
      Basin derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper Imagery (early 1990s).
      
      Note: Minor corrections have been made since original release (1997).  Refer to Process_Steps for details.
    Purpose:
      These data are designed for regional scale
      landuse/landcover analysis.  Specific application areas
      include non-point source pollution modeling, broad scale
      wildlife habitat analysis, and regional landuse inventories.
      The data are available in either Arc/Info GRID format (a
      raster format) or as polygon coverages (vector) clipped
      into QUAD tiles.  The GRID dataset is the whole area (VT
      & Lake Champlain Basin) and is approximately 34 MB.
      Vectorization causes a huge increase in dataset size,
      necessitating a relatively small tile sheme.  Each quad is
      about 4 MB as a coverage, and 9 exported.

    The minimum mapping unit for this dataset is 2 acres and
    a grid cell size of 25 meters.  Many areas of the study
    region were updated with previously developed vector
    GIS  data layers. In some cases, these vector data sets
    may be older than the the imagery used for the
    classification.

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    N/A for raster data
    Not all areas were updated with vector data sets, and
    different vector datasets have differing levels of accuracy,
    so the data quality may vary across the spatial extent of
    the study area.
  Completeness_Report:
    Four LANDSAT Thematic Mapper images were classified
    into 8 spectral classes, using Erdas Imagine software.
    Path    Row    Date
    13        29         4/27/91

    14        30         5/09/93
    The supervised classification yielded the following spectral classes
    (class-codes based on VGIS's "Land Use/Land Cover Codes" standard - refer to VGIS
    Part2-Section C) -
    001 urban/built up
    211 row crop
    212 hay/pasture
    024 other agriculture and mixed open
    003 brush/transitional
    041 deciduous
    042 coniferous forest
    043 mixed forest
    005 water
    The Following classes were added using previously developed vector datasets -
    011 residential
    012 commercial
    013 industrial
    014 transportation/utilities
    017 other urban
    2111 row crop (corn)
    2121 hay/pasture (hay)
    022 orchard
    061 forested wetland
    062 non-forested wetland
    007 barren lands
    The vector datasets were gridded using ArcInfo 7.0.4 with a 25 meter cell size,
    and overlaid with the classified satellite imagery in a raster GIS environment.
    The order of overlay of GIS layers was as follows -
    1. LANDSAT spectral land cover classification
    Canadian GIS data
    2. Orchards
    3. Barren
    4. Surface Waters
    5. Wetlands
    6. Urban
    7. Roads/Utilities
    Vermont/New York Data
    8. Orchards
    9. Barren
    10. Surface Waters
    11. Wetlands
    12. Urban
    13. Roads/Utilities

        The accuracy of the classification is 86% (86% of the
        pixels were classified correctly).

      Process_Description:
        Thomas Millette updated the final land cover grid to
        correct errors introduced due to problems with the GIS
        overlay data sets.
        Two errors were corrected -
        1) Surface waters data were missing in the vicinity of Lewis
        Creek (VT).
        2) Portions of some lakes in the Lake George area were
        improperly labeled as wetlands.
        Operator - Eric Pyle, VCGI
      Process_Date: 19980128
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:  VCGI correct erroneous cell coding in the Finn Basin area of Fayston, VT (near Mad River Glen Ski area).
        Area was erroneously coded as Barren Land (7).  VCGI used the ArcInfo GRID module (FILLREGION) to change this area
        to Decidous Forest (41).  Metadata was updated to reflect this minor correction.  Data was reloaded into the VGIS Data Warehouse.
