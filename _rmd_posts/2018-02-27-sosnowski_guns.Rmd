So, this isn't my normal post about data science tools and approaches.  Instead, I am going to get much more political.  Since the Feb XX, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School I have been more than humbled by the courage, activisim, and bad-assedness of the students.  As a freshly humbled old guy, I hope to do a little something locally to push the gun-safety dialogue forward in my local community.
