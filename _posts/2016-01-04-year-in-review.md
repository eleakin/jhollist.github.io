I haven't ever thought about doing this before, but I was quite inspired by David Miller's post.  So inspired, that I have decided to do it myself!  In no particular order, a quick rundown of what I did in 2015.

- USGS Drought Viz
- Lake Trophic State Paper Accepted
- Microcystin and chlorophyll *a* associations paper drafted 
- Three R Trainings (well one was in Dec 2014)
- rhodyRstats
- quickampr
- lawn
