        <h3>Research:</h3>
        
        <h4>Statement of Research Interests:</h4> 
        <p>It is my general research philosophy to conduct nationally relevant research and
        apply the results of that research to locally important issues. Both levels of research serve to inform
        environmental policy and improve the environment, which is the ultimate goal of applied environmental research.
        Towards that end, I hope to contribute to research in landscape ecology, geospatial technologies (e.g. geographic
        information systems, spatial statistics, and remote sensing), ecoinformatics/reproducible research/data science,
        and broad scale environmental monitoring and modeling. Specifically, I use broad scale monitoring data (e.g. National     
        Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS), National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)) to explore the   
        links between landscape structure (e.g. landscape composition and configuration) and the ecological condition of 
        receiving waters. Furthermore, I am keenly interested in applying Open Science - open source, open access, and open data 
        - to environmental research conducted by the US EPA.</p>
        
        <h4>Research and Professional Experience:</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Aug 2008 - Present</dt> 
            <dd><em>Research Ecologist</em>, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division,
            Narragansett, RI
            <p>I serve as principle investigator and provide leadership to the division on landscape
            ecological research, on application of geospatial sciences to the understanding of water
            quality in fresh and estuarine waters, and on the use of informatics and information
            management tools in environmental research. In this role, I have developed tools and
            methodologies (GIS and statistical) using numerous software packages and languages (R,
            ArcGIS, GRASS, Python, MS Excel) and have continued prior research on technology
            transfer of data, analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States; and
            developed statistical and modeling tools to facilitate use of defensible techniques in water
            quality criteria development. Previously I have: served as Co-lead on a project studying
            ecosystem services related to nutrient cycling in Northeastern lakes and ponds, was the
            liaison between the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and EPA’s
            Ecosystem Services Research Program (ESRP), was task lead for our lakes ecosystem
            services work, and served as co-task lead for developing decision support tools for a
            project in Narragansett Bay and its watershed. I am currently serving as a co-Task Lead
            on a project exploring cyanobacterial risk in lakes of the Northeastern US. I am also
            exploring the use of data science, Big Data, informatics, and related technologies in our
            various research programs. These data efforts include course work, a linked open data
            project, and involvement with various outside organizations such as the ESIP Federation
            and Data.gov</p></dd>
            
          <dt>May 2006 – July 2008</dt>
            <dd><em>Postdoctoral Landscape Ecologist</em>, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic
            Ecology Division, Narragansett, RI
            <p>Contributed to research and technology transfer of National Coastal Assessment data,
            analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States. Developed statistical and
            modeling tools (e.g. Conditional Probability Analysis with R and Excel) to facilitate use
            of defensible techniques in water quality criteria development. Provided Landscape
            Ecology, Spatial Statistics and GIS support to a variety of ongoing projects at the Atlantic
            Ecology Division and within US EPA’s Office of Research and Development. Explored
            linkages between landscape and downstream receiving waters and examined utility of
            broad scale monitoring data in identifying and assessing ecological impairment.</p></dd>

            Section, New London, CT
            <p>Continued prior research on multi-scale interactions between landscape structure (via
            NLCD) and sediment metal concentrations (via EMAP) and predictive modeling of
            estuarine impairment. Worked with students, faculty and colleagues in the Marine
            Sciences Section, the International Ice Patrol, and Information Services Division on a
            wide variety of Geographic Information Systems projects.</p></dd>

            <dd><em>Postdoctoral Associate</em>, American Institute of Biological Sciences, National Ecological
            <p>Observatory (NEON) Project Office, Washington, DC
            Researched and assisted in planning of ecological observatories designed to address the
            National Research Council’s Environmental Grand Challenges. Made specific
            contributions in the design of the land use change component of NEON and design of a
            Multi-Scaled Remote Sensing System designed to support and develop NEON analytical
            tools and ecological forecasting models. Other duties included managing Geographic
            Information Systems operations in the Project Office, maintaining the NEON web
            presence (http://www.neoninc.org), interacting with research scientists and educators on
            the NEON Senior Management Team and National Network Design Committee, and
            assisting with the day-to-day operations of the NEON Project Office.</p></dd>

            <p>USEPA Atlantic Ecology Division/University of Rhode Island Northeast Environmental
            Research Training Program, Narragansett, RI/Kingston, RI
            Used monitoring data from the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
            (EMAP) and the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) to explore relationships between
            landscape structure and indicators of estuarine condition. I specifically researched the
            accuracy of the NLCD at multiple spatial scales, the role of spatial scale on the
            relationship between landscape organization (e.g. landscape composition) and ecological
            health and integrity of Atlantic coast estuaries, and built predictive models of estuarine
            condition designed to locate estuaries with impacted ecological integrity. As member of
            Landscape Ecology Working Group, discussed and assisted on projects at USEPA
            Atlantic Ecology Division and URI utilizing landscape ecology, spatial analysis and
            broad scale environmental monitoring data, in particular NLCD and EMAP.</p></dd>
